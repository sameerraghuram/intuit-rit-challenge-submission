[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/sameerraghuram/intuit-rit-challenge-submission)

I have put my code in the ipython notebook called rit-intuit-challenge.ipynb

To run this ipython noteook, click the build badge (launch-binder) above. Or you can try this <a href="http://104.197.121.217/user/b77e1625258b776700029d278c06e1b0/notebooks/rit-intuit-challenge.ipynb">link</a>.
Or, if it doesn't work, simply do the following:
- Go to <a href="http://mybinder.org/">mybinder.org</a>
- Paste the link to the github repo on the build the repository textbox and hit submit.
  * The link to copy is : https://github.com/sameerraghuram/intuit-rit-challenge-submission.git
- Once the repo is done building, hit the launch button on the console to launch an interactive jupyter session
- Click on the notebook to start interacting!
